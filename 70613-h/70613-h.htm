<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">More</span> than eight years ago, you
sent to us in America a document
with the above heading.
It is as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“A common origin, a common faith, and,
we sincerely believe, a common cause, urge
us, at the present moment, to address you on
the subject of that system of Negro Slavery
which still prevails so extensively, and, even
under kindly disposed masters, with such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
frightful results, in many of the vast regions
of the Western world.</p>

<p>“We will not dwell on the ordinary topics,—on
the progress of civilization, on the advance
of freedom everywhere, on the rights
and requirements of the nineteenth century;
but we appeal to you very seriously to reflect
and to ask counsel of God how far such a
state of things is in accordance with His
Holy Word, the inalienable rights of immortal
souls, and the pure and merciful spirit of the
Christian religion. We do not shut our eyes
to the difficulties, nay, the dangers, that might
beset the immediate abolition of that long-established
system. We see and admit the
necessity of preparation for so great an event;
but, in speaking of indispensable preliminaries,
we cannot be silent on those laws of your
country which, in direct contravention of
God’s own law, ‘instituted in the time of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
man’s innocency,’ deny in effect to the Slave
the sanctity of marriage, with all its joys,
rights, and obligations; which separate, at the
will of the master, the wife from the husband
and the children from the parents. Nor can
we be silent on that awful system which either
by statute or by custom interdicts to any race
of man or any portion of the human family
education in the truths of the Gospel and the
ordinances of Christianity. A remedy applied
to these two evils alone would commence the
amelioration of their sad condition. We appeal
to you, then, as sisters, as wives, and as
mothers, to raise your voices to your fellow-citizens,
and your prayers to God, for the
removal of this affliction and disgrace from
the Christian world.</p>

<p>“We do not say these things in a spirit of
self-complacency, as though our nation were
free from the guilt it perceives in others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span></p>

<p>“We acknowledge with grief and shame
our heavy share in this great sin. We acknowledge
that our forefathers introduced,
nay, compelled the adoption of slavery in
those mighty colonies. We humbly confess
it before Almighty God; and it is because we
so deeply feel and so unfeignedly avow our
own complicity, that we now venture to implore
your aid to wipe away our common
crime and our common dishonour.”</p>
</div>

<p>This Address, splendidly illuminated on
vellum, was sent to our shores at the head of
twenty-six folio volumes, containing considerably
more than half-a-million of signatures of
British women. It was forwarded to me
with a letter from a British nobleman now
occupying one of the highest official positions
in England, with a request on behalf of these
ladies that it should be in any possible way<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
presented to the attention of my countrywomen.</p>

<p>This Memorial, as it now stands in its solid
oaken case, with its heavy folios, each bearing
on its back the imprint of the American
eagle, forms a most unique library, a singular
monument of an international expression of a
moral idea.</p>

<p>No right-thinking person can find aught to
be objected against the substance or the form
of this memorial. It is temperate, just, and
kindly, and on the high ground of Christian
equality, where it places itself, may be regarded
as a perfectly proper expression of
sentiment, as between blood-relations and
equals in two different nations.</p>

<p>The signatures to this appeal are not the
least remarkable part of it; for, beginning at
the very steps of the throne, they go down to
the names of women in the very humblest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
conditions in life, and represent all that Great
Britain possesses, not only of highest and
wisest, but of plain, homely common sense
and good feeling. Names of wives of cabinet-ministers
appear on the same page with
the names of wives of humble labourers,—names
of duchesses and countesses, of wives
of generals, ambassadors, savans, and men of
letters, mingled with names traced in trembling
characters by hands evidently unused to
hold the pen and stiffened by lowly toil. Nay,
so deep and expansive was the feeling, that
British subjects in foreign lands had their representation.
Among the signatures are those
of foreign residents from Paris to Jerusalem.
Autographs so diverse, and collected from
sources so various, have seldom been found in
juxtaposition. They remain at this day a
silent witness of a most singular tide of feeling
which at that time swept over the British<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
community, and <em>made</em> for itself an expression,
even at the risk of offending the sensibilities
of an equal and powerful nation.</p>

<p>No reply to that address, in any such tangible
and monumental form, has ever been
possible. It was impossible to canvass our
vast territories with the zealous and indefatigable
industry with which England was canvassed
for signatures. In America, those
possessed of the spirit which led to this efficient
action had no leisure for it. All their
time and energies were already absorbed in
direct efforts to remove the great evil concerning
which the minds of their English
sisters had been newly aroused, and their
only answer was the silent continuance of
these efforts.</p>

<p>From the Slaveholding States, however, as
was to be expected, came a flood of indignant
recrimination and rebuke. No one act, perhaps,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
ever produced more frantic irritation or
called out more unsparing abuse. It came
with the whole united weight of the British
aristocracy and commonalty on the most diseased
and sensitive part of our national life;
and it stimulated that fierce excitement which
was working before, and has worked since,
till it has broken out into open war.</p>

<p>The time has come, however, when such
an astonishing page has been turned in the
anti-slavery history of America, that the women
of our country, feeling that the great
anti-slavery work to which their English sisters
exhorted them is almost done, may properly
and naturally feel moved to reply to
their appeal, and lay before them the history
of what has occurred since the receipt of their
affectionate and Christian address.</p>

<p>Your address reached us just as a great
moral conflict was coming to its intensest
point.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span></p>

<p>The agitation kept up by the anti-slavery
portion of America, by England, and by the
general sentiment of humanity in Europe, had
made the situation of the slaveholding aristocracy
intolerable. As one of them at the
time expressed it, they felt themselves under
the ban of the civilized world. Two courses
only were open to them: to abandon slave
institutions, the sources of their wealth and
political power, or to assert them with such
an overwhelming national force as to compel
the respect and assent of mankind. They
chose the latter.</p>

<p>To this end they determined to seize on
and control all the resources of the Federal
Government, and to spread their institutions
through new States and Territories until the
balance of power should fall into their hands,
and they should be able to force slavery into
all the Free States.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span></p>

<p>A leading Southern senator boasted that he
would yet call the roll of his slaves on Bunker
Hill; and, for a while, the political successes
of the Slave Power were such as to suggest
to New England that this was no impossible
event.</p>

<p>They repealed the Missouri Compromise,
which had hitherto stood, like the Chinese
wall, between our North-western Territories
and the irruptions of slaveholding barbarians.</p>

<p>Then came the struggle between Freedom
and Slavery in the new Territory,—the battle
for Kansas and Nebraska, fought with fire
and sword and blood, where a race of men, of
whom John Brown was the immortal type,
acted over again the courage, the perseverance,
and the military religious ardour of the old
Covenanters of Scotland, and, like them, redeemed
the Ark of Liberty at the price of
their own blood, and blood dearer than their
own.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span></p>

<p>The time of the Presidential canvass which
elected Mr. Lincoln was the crisis of this
great battle. The conflict had become narrowed
down to the one point of the extension
of slave-territory. If the slaveholders could
get States enough, they could control and
rule; if they were outnumbered by Free
States, their institutions, by the very law of
their nature, would die of suffocation. Therefore,
Fugitive-Slave Law, District of Columbia,
Inter-State Slave-Trade, and what not,
were all thrown out of sight for a grand rally
on this vital point. A President was elected
pledged to opposition to this one thing alone,—a
man known to be in favour of the Fugitive-Slave
Law and other so-called compromises
of the Constitution, but honest and
faithful in his determination on this one subject.
That this was indeed the vital point
was shown by the result. The moment Lincoln’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
election was ascertained, the slaveholders
resolved to destroy the Union they
could no longer control.</p>

<p>They met and organized a Confederacy
which they openly declared to be the first
republic founded on the right and determination
of the white man to enslave the black
man; and, spreading their banners, declared
themselves to the Christian world of the nineteenth
century as a nation organized with the
full purpose and intent of perpetuating slavery.</p>

<p>But in the course of the struggle that followed,
it became important for the new Confederation
to secure the assistance of foreign
powers, and infinite pains were then taken to
blind and bewilder the mind of England as to
the real issues of the conflict in America.</p>

<p>It has been often and earnestly asserted
that slavery had nothing to do with this conflict;
that it was a mere struggle for power;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
that the only object was to restore the Union
as it was, with all its abuses. It is to be admitted
that expressions have proceeded from
the National Administration which naturally
gave rise to misapprehension, and therefore
we beg to speak to you on this subject more
fully.</p>

<p>And, first, the declaration of the Confederate
States themselves is proof enough, that,
whatever may be declared on the other side,
the maintenance of slavery is regarded by
them as the vital object of their movement.</p>

<p>We ask your attention under this head to
the declaration of their Vice-President, Stephens,
in that remarkable speech delivered on
the 21st of March, 1861, at Savannah, Georgia,
wherein he declares the object and purposes
of the new Confederacy. It is one of
the most extraordinary papers which our century
has produced. I quote from the <em>verbatim</em><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
report in the Savannah <cite>Republican</cite> of the
address as it was delivered in the Athenæum
of that city, on which occasion, says the
newspaper from which I copy, “Mr. Stephens
took his seat amid a burst of enthusiasm
and applause such as the Athenæum has
never had displayed within its walls within
‘the recollection of the oldest inhabitant.’”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Last, not least, the new Constitution has
put at rest <em>for ever</em> all the agitating questions
relating to our peculiar institution,—African
Slavery as it exists among us, the proper
<em>status</em> of the negro in our form of civilization.
<em>This was the immediate cause of the late
rupture and present revolution.</em> Jefferson, in
his forecast, had anticipated this, as the ‘rock
upon which the old Union would split.’ He
was right. What was conjecture with him
is now a realized fact. But whether he fully<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
comprehended the great truth upon which
that rock <em>stood</em> and <em>stands</em> may be doubted.
<em>The prevailing ideas entertained by him and
most of the leading statesmen at the time of the
formation of the old Constitution were, that the
enslavement of the African was in violation of
the laws of Nature, that it was wrong in principle,
socially, morally, and politically.</em> It was
an evil they knew not well how to deal with;
but the general opinion of the men of that
day was, that, somehow or other, in the order
of Providence, the institution would be evanescent,
and pass away. This idea, though
not incorporated in the Constitution, was the
prevailing idea at the time. The Constitution,
it is true, secured every essential
guaranty to the institution, while it should
last; and hence no argument can be justly
used against the Constitutional guaranties
thus secured, because of the common sentiment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
of the day. <em>Those ideas, however, were
fundamentally wrong. They rested upon the
assumption of the equality of races. This was an
error.</em> It was a sandy foundation: and the
idea of a government built upon it—when
‘the storm came and the wind blew, it fell.’</p>

<p>“<em>Our new government is founded upon exactly
the opposite ideas: its foundations are laid,
its corner-stone rests upon the great truth that
the negro is not equal to the white man; that
slavery, subordination to the superior race, is his
natural and moral condition.</em> (Applause.) <em>This
our new government is the first, in the history of
the world, based upon this great physical, philosophical,
and moral truth.</em></p>

<p>“This truth has been slow in the process
of its development, like all other truths in the
various departments of science. It is so
even amongst us. Many who hear me, perhaps,
can recollect well that this truth was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
not generally admitted, even within their day.
The errors of the past generation still clung
to many as late as twenty years ago. Those
at the North who still cling to these errors
with a zeal above knowledge we justly denominate
fanatics. All fanaticism springs from
an aberration of the mind, from a defect in
reasoning. It is a species of insanity. One
of the most striking characteristics of insanity,
in many instances, is forming correct
conclusions from fancied or erroneous premises.
So with the <em>anti-slavery</em> fanatics:
their conclusions are right, if their premises
are. They assume that the negro is equal
and hence conclude that he is entitled to
equal privileges and rights with the white
man. If their premises were correct, their
conclusions would be logical and just; but
their premises being wrong, their whole argument
fails.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span></p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“In the conflict thus far, success has been
on our side complete, throughout the length
and breadth of the Confederate States. It is
upon this, as I have stated, our social fabric
is firmly planted; and I cannot permit myself
to doubt the ultimate success of a full recognition
of this principle throughout the civilized
and enlightened world.</p>

<p>“As I have stated, the truth of this principle
may be slow in development, as all
truths are, and ever have been, in the various
branches of science. It was so with the
principles announced by Galileo; it was so
with Adam Smith and his principles of political
economy; it was so with Harvey in his
theory of the circulation of the blood. It is
said that not a single one of the medical profession,
at the time of the announcement of
the truths made by him, admitted them; now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
they are universally acknowledged. May we
not, therefore, look with confidence to the
ultimate universal acknowledgment of the
truths upon which our system rests? It is
the first government ever instituted upon
principles in strict conformity to Nature and
the ordination of Providence in furnishing
the material of human society. Many governments
have been founded upon the principles
of certain classes; but the classes thus
enslaved were of the same race and in violation
of the laws of Nature. Our system
commits no such violation of Nature’s laws.
The negro, by Nature, or by the curse
against Canaan, is fitted for that condition
which he occupies in our system. The architect,
in the construction of buildings, lays
the foundation with the proper material,—the
granite; then comes the brick or marble.
The substratum of our society is made of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
material fitted by Nature for it; and by experience
we know that it is best not only for
the superior, but the inferior race, that it
should be so. It is indeed in conformity with
the Creator. It is not safe for us to inquire
into the wisdom of His ordinances, or to
question them. For His own purposes He
has made one race to differ from another, as
one star differeth from another in glory.
The great objects of humanity are best attained,
when conformed to His laws and decrees
in the formation of government as well
as in all things else. Our Confederacy is
founded on a strict conformity with those
laws. <em>This stone, which was rejected by the
first builders, has become the chief stone of the
corner in our new edifice!</em>”</p>
</div>

<p>Thus far the declarations of the slaveholding
Confederacy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span></p>

<p>On the other hand, the declarations of the
President and the Republican party, as to their
intention to restore “the Union as it was,”
require an explanation. It is the doctrine of
the Republican party, that Freedom is national
and Slavery sectional; that the Constitution
of the United States was designed for the promotion
of liberty, and not of slavery; that
its framers contemplated the gradual abolition
of slavery; and that in the hands of an anti-slavery
majority it could be so wielded as
peaceably to extinguish this great evil.</p>

<p>They reasoned thus. Slavery ruins land,
and requires fresh territory for profitable working.
Slavery increases a dangerous population,
and requires an expansion of this population
for safety. Slavery, then, being hemmed in
by impassable limits, emancipation in each
State becomes a necessity.</p>

<p><em>By restoring the Union as it was</em> the Republican<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
party meant the Union in the sense contemplated
by the original framers of it, who,
as has been admitted by Stephens, in his speech
just quoted, were from principle opposed to
slavery. It was, then, restoring a <em>status</em> in
which, by the inevitable operation of natural
laws, peaceful emancipation would become a
certainty.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, during the past year, the
Republican Administration, with all the unwonted
care of organizing an army and navy,
and conducting military operations on an immense
scale, have proceeded to demonstrate
the feasibility of overthrowing slavery by
purely Constitutional measures. To this end
they have instituted a series of movements
which have made this year more fruitful in
anti-slavery triumphs than any other since the
emancipation of the British West Indies.</p>

<p>The District of Columbia, as belonging
strictly to the National Government, and to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
no separate State, has furnished a fruitful subject
of remonstrance from British Christians
with America. We have abolished slavery
there, and thus wiped out the only blot of territorial
responsibility on our escutcheon.</p>

<p>By another act, equally grand in principle,
and far more important in its results, slavery
is for ever excluded from the Territories of the
United States.</p>

<p>By another act, America has consummated
the long-delayed treaty with Great Britain for
the suppression of the slave-trade. In ports
whence slave-vessels formerly sailed with the
connivance of the port-officers, the Administration
has placed men who stand up to their
duty, and for the first time in our history the
slave-trader is convicted and hung as a pirate.
This abominable secret traffic has been wholly
demolished by the energy of the Federal Government.</p>

<p>Lastly, and more significant still, the United<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
States Government has in its highest official
capacity taken distinct anti-slavery ground, and
presented to the country a plan of peaceable
emancipation with suitable compensation.
This noble-spirited and generous offer has
been urged on the Slaveholding States by the
Chief Executive with an earnestness and sincerity
of which history in after-times will
make honourable account in recording the
events of Mr. Lincoln’s administration.</p>

<p>Now, when a President and Administration
who have done all these things declare their
intention of restoring “<em>the Union as it was</em>,”
ought not the world fairly to interpret their
words by their actions and their avowed principles?
Is it not <em>necessary</em> to infer that they
mean by it the Union as it was in the intent
of its anti-slavery framers, under which, by
the exercise of normal Constitutional powers,
slavery should be peaceably abolished?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span></p>

<p>We are aware that this theory of the Constitution
has been disputed by certain Abolitionists;
but it is conceded, as you have seen, by
the Secessionists. Whether it be a just theory
or not is, however, nothing to our purpose at
present. We only assert that such is the professed
belief of the present Administration of
the United States, and such are the acts by
which they have illustrated their belief.</p>

<p>But this is but half the story of the anti-slavery
triumphs of this year. We have
shown you what has been done for freedom
by the simple use of the ordinary Constitutional
forces of the Union. We are now to
show you what has been done to the same
end by the Constitutional war-power of the
nation.</p>

<p>By this power it has been this year decreed
that every slave of a rebel who reaches the
lines of our army becomes a free man; that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
all slaves found deserted by their masters become
free men; that every slave employed
in any service for the United States thereby
obtains his liberty; and that every slave employed
against the United States in any capacity
obtains his liberty: and lest the army
should contain officers disposed to remand
slaves to their masters, the power of judging
and delivering up slaves is denied to army-officers,
and all such acts are made penal.</p>

<p>By this act, the Fugitive-Slave Law is for
all present purposes practically repealed.
With this understanding and provision,
wherever our armies march, they carry liberty
with them. For, be it remembered that our
army is almost entirely a volunteer one, and
that the most zealous and ardent volunteers
are those who have been for years fighting
with tongue and pen the Abolition battle. So
marked is the character of our soldiers in this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
respect, that they are now familiarly designated
in the official military despatches of the Confederate
States as “The Abolitionists.” Conceive
the results, when an army, so empowered
by national law, marches through a slave-territory.
One regiment alone has to our certain
knowledge liberated two thousand slaves
during the past year, and this regiment is but
one out of hundreds. We beg to lay before
you some details given by an eye-witness of
what has recently been done in this respect in
the Department of the South.</p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">
<p class="right">
“<em>On Board Steamer from Fortress Monroe</em><br>
<span style="padding-right: 2em"><em>to Baltimore</em>, Nov. 14, 1862.</span><br>
</p>

<p>“Events of no ordinary interest have just
occurred in the Department of the South.
The negro troops have been tested, and, to
their great joy, though not contrary to their
own expectations, they have triumphed, not
only over enemies armed with muskets and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
swords, but over what the black man dreads
most, sharp and cruel prejudices.</p>

<p>“General Saxton, on the 28th of October,
sent the captured steamer Darlington, Captain
Crandell, down the coast of Georgia, and to
Fernandina, Florida, to obtain recruits for the
First Regiment South-Carolina Volunteers.
Lieutenant-Colonel O. T. Beard, of the
Forty-Eighth New-York Volunteers, was
given the command of the expedition. In
addition to obtaining recruits, the condition
and wants of the recent refugees from slavery
along the coast were to be looked into, and, if
occasion should offer, it was permitted to ‘feel
the enemy.’ At St. Simond’s, Georgia, Captain
Trowbridge, with thirty-five men of the
‘Hunter Regiment of First South-Carolina
Volunteers,’ who had been stationed there for
three months, together with twenty-seven
more men, were received on board. With<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
this company of sixty-two men the Darlington
proceeded to Fernandina.</p>

<p>“On arriving, a meeting of the coloured
men was called to obtain enlistments. The
large church was crowded. After addresses
had been made by the writer and Colonel
Beard, one hundred men volunteered at once,
and the number soon reached about one hundred
and twenty-five. Such, however, were
the demands of Fort Clinch and the Quartermaster’s
Department for labourers, that
Colonel Rich, commanding the fort, consented
to only twenty-five men leaving. This was a
sad disappointment, and one which some determined
not to bear. The twenty-five men
were carefully selected from among those not
employed either on the fort or in the Quartermaster’s
Department, and put on board.
Amid the farewells and benedictions of hundreds
of their friends on shore they took their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
departure, to prove the truth or falsity of the
charge, ‘The black man can never fight.’
On calling the roll, a few miles from port, it
was found our twenty-five men had increased
to fifty-four. Determined not to be foiled in
their purpose of being soldiers, it was found
that thirty men had quietly found their way on
board just at break of day, and had concealed
themselves in the hold of the ship. When
asked why they did so, their reply was,—</p>

<p>“‘Oh, we want to fight for our liberty,
and for de liberty of our wives and children.’</p>

<p>“‘But would you dare to face your old
masters?’</p>

<p>“‘Oh, yes, yes! why, we would fight to
de death to get our families,’ was the quick
response.</p>

<p>“No one doubted their sincerity. Muskets
were soon in their hands, and no time
was lost in drilling them. Our steamer, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
very frail one, had been barricaded around
the bow and stern, and also provided with
two twelve-pounder Parrott guns. These
guns had to be worked by black men, under
the direction of the captain of the steamer.
Our fighting men numbered only about one
hundred and ten, and fifty of them were raw
recruits. The expedition was not a very formidable
one, still all seemed to have an unusual
degree of confidence as to its success.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“<em>November 6.</em> The women and children
(about fifty) taken from St. Simond’s on the
day previous were now landed for safety in
St. Catherine’s, as a more hazardous work
was to be undertaken. Much of the night
was spent in getting wood for the steamer,
killing beeves, and cooking meats, rice, and
corn, for our women and children on shore,
and for the troops. The men needed no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
‘driver’s lash’ to incite them to labour. Sleep
and rest were almost unwelcome, for they
were preparing to go up Sapelo River, along
whose banks, on the beautiful plantations,
were their fathers, mothers, brothers, sisters,
wives, and children. Weeks and months before,
some of the men had left those loved
ones, with a promise to return, ‘if de good
Lord jis open de way.’</p>

<p>“At five o’clock on Friday morning, November
7, we were under way. Captain Budd,
of the gun-boat Potomska, had kindly promised
the evening before to accompany us past the
most dangerous places. On reaching his station
in Sapelo Sound, we found him in readiness.
Our little fleet, led by the Potomska,
and followed by the Darlington, sailed proudly
up the winding Sapelo, now through marshes,
and then past large and beautiful plantations.
It was very affecting to see our soldiers watching<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
intensely the coloured forms on land, one
saying, in the agony of deepest anxiety, ‘Oh,
Mas’r, my wife and chillen lib dere;’ and another
singing out, ‘Dere, dere my brodder,’
or ‘my sister.’ The earnest longings of their
poor, anguish-riven hearts for landings, and
then the sad, inexpressible regrets as the
steamer passed, must be imagined,—they cannot
be described.</p>

<p>“The first landing was made at a picket-station
on Charles Hopkins’s plantation. The
enemy was driven back; a few guns and a
sword only captured. The Potomska came
to anchorage, for lack of sufficient water, a
few miles above, at Reuben King’s plantation.
Here we witnessed a rich scene. Some fifty
negroes appeared on the banks, about thirty
rods distant from their master’s house, and
some distance from the Darlington. They
gazed upon us with intense feelings, alternately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
turning their eyes toward their master,
who was watching them from his piazza, and
toward our steamer, which, as yet, had given
them no assurances of landing. The moment
she headed to the shore, their doubts were
dispersed, and they gave us such a welcome
as angels would be satisfied with. Some few
women were so filled with joy, that they ran,
leaped, clapped their hands, and cried, ‘Glory
to God! Glory to God!’</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“After relieving the old planter of twenty
thousand dollars’ worth of humanity, that is,
fifty-two slaves, and the leather of his tannery,
we re-embarked. Our boats were sent once
and again, however, to the shore for men,
who, having heard the steam-whistle, came
in greatest haste from distant plantations.</p>

<p>“As the Potomska could go no farther,
Captain Budd kindly offered to accompany us<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
with one gun’s crew. We were glad to have
his company and the services of the crew,
as we had only one gun’s crew of coloured
men. Above us was a bend in the river, and
a high bluff covered with thick woods. There
we apprehended danger, for the Rebels had
had ample time to collect their forces. The
men were carefully posted, fully instructed as
to their duties and dangers by Colonel Beard.
Our Parrotts were manned, and everything
was in readiness. No sooner were we within
rifle-shot than the enemy opened upon us a
heavy fire from behind the bank and trees,
and also from the tops of the trees. Our
speed being slow, and the river’s bend quite
large, we were within range of the enemy’s
guns for some time. How well our troops
bore themselves will be seen by Captain Budd’s
testimony.</p>

<p>“Our next landing was made at Daniel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
McDonald’s plantation. His extensive and
valuable salt-works were demolished, and he
himself taken prisoner. By documents captured,
it was ascertained that he was a Rebel
of the worst kind. We took only a few of
his slaves, as he drove back into the woods
about ninety of them just before our arrival.
One fine-looking man came hobbling down
on a crutch. McDonald had shot off one of
his legs some eighteen months before. The
next plantation had some five hundred slaves
on it; several of our troops had come from
it, and also had relatives there; but the lateness
of the hour, and the dangerous points
to be passed on our return, admonished us to
retreat.</p>

<p>“Our next attack was expected at the
bluff. The enemy had improved the time
since we parted from them in gathering reinforcements.
Colonel Beard prepared the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
men for a warm fire. While everything was
in readiness, and the steamer dropping down
hard upon the enemy, the writer passed
around among the men, who were waiting
coolly for the moment of attack, and asked
them if they found their courage failing.
‘Oh, no, Mas’r, our trust be in de Lord.
We only want fair chance at ’em,’ was the
unanimous cry.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“Most people have doubted the courage
of negroes, and their ability to stand a warm
fire of the enemy. The engagements of this
day were not an open field fight, to be sure,
but the circumstances were peculiar. They
were taken by surprise, the enemy concealed,
his force not known, and some of the troops
had been enlisted only two days. Captain
Budd, a brave and experienced officer, and
eye-witness of both engagements, has kindly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
given his opinion, which we are sure will
vindicate the policy, as well as justness, of
arming the coloured man for his own freedom
at least.</p>

<p>“On reaching his ship, Captain Budd led
our retreat. It had been agreed, after full
consultation on the subject, that, in our descent
down the river it was best to burn the
buildings of Captain Hopkins and Colonel
Brailsford. Both of these places were strong
picket-stations, particularly the latter. Brailsford
had been down with a small force a few
days before our arrival at St. Catharine’s, and
shot one of our contrabands; wounded mortally,
as was supposed, another, and carried
off four women and three men. He had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
also whipped to death, three weeks before, a
slave for attempting to make his escape. We
had on board Sam Miller, a former slave, who
had received over three hundred lashes for
refusing to inform on a few of his fellows
who had escaped.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“On passing among the men, as we were
leaving the scenes of action, I inquired if
they had grown any to-day? Many simultaneously
exclaimed,—‘Oh, yes, Massa, we
have grown three inches!’ Sam said,—‘I
feel a heap more of a man!’</p>

<p>“With the lurid flames still lighting up all
the region behind, and the bright rays of the
smiling moon before them, they formed a
circle on the lower deck, and around the
hatchway leading to the hold, where were the
women and children captured during the day,
and on bended knees they offered up sincere<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
and heartfelt thanksgivings to Almighty God
for the mercies of the day. Such fervent
prayers for the President, for the hearing of
his Proclamation by all in bonds, and for the
ending of the war and slavery, were seldom, if
ever, heard before. About one hour was
spent in singing and prayer. Those waters
surely never echoed with such sounds before.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“Our steamer left Beaufort without a soldier,
and returned, after an absence of twelve
days, with one hundred and fifty-six fighting
coloured men, some of whom dropped the hoe,
took a musket, and were at once soldiers,
ready to fight for the freedom of others.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>It is conceded on all sides, that, wherever
our armies have had occupancy, there slavery
has been practically abolished. The fact was
recognized by President Lincoln in his last<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
appeal to the loyal Slave States to consummate
emancipation.</p>

<p>Another noticeable act of our Government
in behalf of Liberty is the official provision
it makes for the wants of the thousands
of helpless human beings thus thrown upon
our care. Taxed with the burden of an immense
war, with the care of thousands of
sick and wounded, the United States Government
has cheerfully voted rations for helpless
slaves, no less than wages to the helpful ones.
The United States Government pays teachers
to instruct them, and overseers to guide their
industrial efforts. A free-labour experiment
is already in successful operation among the
beautiful sea-islands in the neighbourhood of
Beaufort, which, even under most disadvantageous
circumstances, is fast demonstrating
how much more efficiently men will work
from hope and liberty than from fear and constraint.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
Thus, even amid the roar of cannon
and the confusion of war, cotton-planting,
as a free-labour institution, is beginning its
infant life, to grow hereafter to a glorious
manhood.</p>

<p>The amount received by the United States
Government from the sale of cotton raised by
two thousand families, is stated to exceed a
million of dollars.</p>

<p>Lastly, the great, decisive measure of the
war has appeared,—<em>The President’s Proclamation
of Emancipation</em>.</p>

<p>This also has been much misunderstood
and misrepresented in England. It has been
said to mean virtually this:—Be loyal, and
you shall keep your slaves; rebel, and they
shall be free.</p>

<p>But let us remember what we have just
seen of the purpose and meaning of the
Union to which the rebellious States are invited<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
back. It is to a Union which has abolished
slavery in the district of Columbia,
and interdicted slavery in the Territories,—which
vigorously represses the slave-trade,
and hangs the convicted slaver as a pirate,—which
necessitates emancipation by denying
expansion to slavery, and facilitates it by the
offer of compensation. Any Slaveholding
States which should return to such a Union
might fairly be supposed to return with the
purpose of peaceable emancipation. The
President’s Proclamation simply means this:—Come
in, and emancipate peaceably with
compensation; stay out, and I emancipate,
nor will I protect you from the consequences.</p>

<p>That continuance in the Union is thus understood,
is already made manifest by the
votes of Missouri and Delaware in the recent
elections. Both of these States have given
strong majorities for emancipation. Missouri,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
long tending towards emancipation,
has already planted herself firmly on the
great rock of Freedom, and thrown out her
bold and eloquent appeal to the Free States of
the North for aid in overcoming the difficulties
of her position. Other States will
soon follow; nor is it too much to hope, that
before a new year has gone far in its course,
the sacred fire of Freedom will have flashed
along the whole line of the Border States responsive
to the generous proposition of the
President and Congress, and that universal
emancipation will have become a fixed fact
in the American Union.</p>

<p>Will our Sisters in England feel no heartbeat
at that event? Is it not one of the predicted
voices of the latter day, saying under
the whole heavens, “It is done: the kingdoms
of this world are become the kingdoms
of our Lord, and of His Christ?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span></p>

<p>And now, Sisters of England, in this solemn,
expectant hour, let us speak to you of
one thing which fills our hearts with pain and
solicitude.</p>

<p>It is an unaccountable fact, and one which
we entreat you seriously to ponder, that the
party which has brought the cause of Freedom
thus far on its way during the past
eventful year has found little or no support
in England. Sadder than this, the party
which makes Slavery the chief corner-stone
of its edifice finds in England its strongest
defenders.</p>

<p>The voices that have spoken for us who
contend for Liberty have been few and scattering.
God forbid that we should forget
those few noble voices, so sadly exceptional
in the general outcry against us! They are,
alas, too few to be easily forgotten. False
statements have blinded the minds of your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
community, and turned the most generous
sentiments of the British heart against us.
The North are fighting for supremacy and
the South for independence, has been the
voice. Independence? for what? to do what?
To prove the doctrine that all men are <em>not</em>
equal. To establish the doctrine that the
white may enslave the negro.</p>

<p>It is natural to sympathize with people who
are fighting for their rights: but if these
prove to be the right of selling children
by the pound, and trading in husbands and
wives as merchantable articles, should not
Englishmen think twice before giving their
sympathy? A pirate-ship on the high seas
is fighting for <em>independence</em>! Let us be consistent.</p>

<p>It has been said that we have been over-sensitive,
thin-skinned. It is one inconvenient
attendant of love and respect, that they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
do induce sensitiveness. A brother or father
turning against one in the hour of trouble, a
friend sleeping in the Gethsemane of our
mortal anguish, does not always find us
armed with divine patience. We loved England;
we respected, revered her; we were
bound to her by ties of blood and race.
Alas! must all these declarations be written
in the past tense?</p>

<p>But that we may not be thought to have
over-estimated the popular tide against us, we
shall express our sense of it in the words of
an English writer, one of the noble few who
have spoken the truth on our side. Referring
to England’s position on this question, he
says:—</p>

<p>“What is the meaning of this? Why does
the English nation, which has made itself
memorable to all time as the destroyer of
negro slavery, which has shrunk from no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
sacrifices to free its own character from that
odious stain, and to close all the countries of
the world against the slave-merchant,—why
is it that the nation which is at the head of
Abolitionism, not only feels no sympathy with
those who are fighting against the slaveholding
conspiracy, but actually desires its success?
Why is the general voice of our press,
the general sentiment of our people bitterly
reproachful to the North, while for the South,
the aggressors in the war, we have either
mild apologies or direct and downright encouragement,—and
this not only from the
Tory and anti-Democratic camp, but from
Liberals, or <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">soi-disant</i> such?</p>

<p>“This strange perversion of feeling prevails
nowhere else. The public of France,
and of the Continent generally, at all events
the Liberal part of it, saw at once on which
side were justice and moral principle, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
gave its sympathies consistently and steadily
to the North. Why is England an exception?”</p>

<p>In the beginning of our struggle, the voices
that reached us across the water said, “If we
were only sure you were fighting for the
abolition of slavery, we should not dare to say
whither our sympathies for your cause might
not carry us.”</p>

<p>Such, as we heard, were the words of
the honoured and religious nobleman who
draughted this very letter which you signed and
sent us, and to which we are now replying.</p>

<p>When these words reached us, we said,
“We can wait; our friends in England will
soon see whither this conflict is tending.” A
year and a half have passed; step after step
has been taken for Liberty; chain after chain
has fallen, till the march of our armies is
choked and clogged by the glad flocking of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
emancipated slaves; the day of final emancipation
is set; the Border States begin to move
in voluntary consent; universal freedom for
all dawns like the sun in the distant horizon:
and still no voice from England. No voice?
Yes, we have heard on the high seas the
voice of a war-steamer, built for a man-stealing
Confederacy with English gold in an English
dockyard, going out of an English harbour,
manned by English sailors, with the full
knowledge of English Government-officers, in
defiance of the Queen’s proclamation of neutrality.
So far has English sympathy overflowed.
We have heard of other steamers,
iron-clad, designed to furnish to a Slavery-defending
Confederacy their only lack,—a
navy for the high seas. We have heard that
the British Evangelical Alliance refuses to
express sympathy with the liberating party,
when requested to do so by the French Evangelical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
Alliance. We find in English religious
newspapers all those sad degrees in the downward
sliding-scale of defending and apologizing
for slaveholders and slaveholding with which
we have so many years contended in our own
country. We find the President’s Proclamation
of Emancipation spoken of in those
papers only as an incitement to servile insurrection.
Nay, more,—we find in your papers,
from thoughtful men, the admission of the
rapid decline of anti-slavery sentiments in
England. Witness the following:—</p>

<p>“The Rev. Mr. Maurice, Principal of the
Working-Men’s College, Great Ormond
Street, delivered the first general lecture of
the term on Saturday evening, and took for
his subject the state of English feeling on the
Slavery question. He said, ‘a few days ago,
in a conversation on the American war, that
some gentlemen connected with the College<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
had confessed to a change in their sympathies
in the matter. On the outbreak of the war,
they had been strong sympathizers with the
Government and the Northern States, but
gradually they had drifted until they found
themselves desiring the success of the seceded
States, and all but free from their anti-slavery
feelings and tendencies.’ These confessions
elicited strong expressions of indignation from
a gentleman present, who had lectured in the
College on the war in Kansas. He (Mr.
Maurice) felt inclined to share in the indignation
expressed; but since, he could not
help feeling that this change was very general
in England.”</p>

<p>Alas, then, England! is it so? In this day
of great deeds and great heroisms, this solemn
hour when the Mighty Redeemer is coming
to break every yoke, do we hear such voices
from England?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span></p>

<p>This very day the writer of this has been
present at a solemn religious festival in the
national capital, given at the home of a portion
of those fugitive slaves who have fled to
our lines for protection,—who, under the
shadow of our flag, find sympathy and succour.
The national day of thanksgiving was
there kept by over a thousand redeemed
slaves, and for whom Christian charity had
spread an ample repast. Our Sisters, we wish
<em>you</em> could have witnessed the scene. We
wish you could have heard the prayer of a
blind old negro, called among his fellows John
the Baptist, when in touching broken English
he poured forth his thanksgivings. We wish
you could have heard the sound of that strange
rhythmical chant which is now forbidden to
be sung on Southern plantations,—the psalm
of this modern exodus,—which combines the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
barbaric fire of the Marseillaise with the religious
fervour of the old Hebrew prophet.</p>

<p>As we were leaving, an aged woman came<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
and lifted up her hands in blessing. “Bressed
be de Lord dat brought me to see dis first
happy day of my life! Bressed be de Lord!”
In all England is there no Amen?</p>

<p>We have been shocked and saddened by
the question asked in an association of Congregational
ministers in England, the very
blood-relations of the liberty-loving Puritans,—“Why
does not the North let the South
go?”</p>

<p>What! give up the point of emancipation
for these four million slaves? Turn our
backs on them, and leave them to their fate?
What! leave our white brothers to run a
career of oppression and robbery, that, as sure
as there is a God that ruleth in the armies of
heaven, will bring down a day of wrath and
doom?</p>

<p>Is it any advantage to people to be educated
in man-stealing as a principle, to be taught<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
systematically to rob the labourer of his wages,
and to tread on the necks of weaker races?
Who among you would wish your sons to
become slave-planters, slave-merchants, slave-dealers?
And shall we leave our brethren to
this fate? Better a generation should die on
the battle-field, that their children may grow
up in liberty and justice. Yes, our sons must
die, their sons must die. We give ours freely;
they die to redeem the very brothers that
slay them; they give their blood in expiation
of this great sin, begun by you in England,
perpetuated by us in America, and for which
God in this great day of judgment is making
inquisition in blood.</p>

<p>In a recent battle fell a Secession colonel,
the last remaining son of his mother, and she
a widow. That mother had sold eleven children
of an old slave-mother, her servant.
That servant went to her and said,—“Missis,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
we even now. You sold all my children.
God took all yourn. Not one to bury either
of us. <em>Now</em>, I forgive you.”</p>

<p>In another battle fell the only son of another
widow. Young, beautiful, heroic, brought
up by his mother in the sacred doctrines of
human liberty, he gave his life an offering as
to a holy cause. He died. No slave-woman
came to tell <em>his</em> mother of God’s justice, for
many slaves have reason to call her blessed.</p>

<p>Now we ask you, Would you change places
with that Southern mother? Would you not
think it a great misfortune for a son or
daughter to be brought into such a system?—a
worse one to become so perverted as to defend
it? Remember, then, that wishing success
to this slavery-establishing effort is only wishing
to the sons and daughters of the South all
the curses that God has written against oppression.
<em>Mark our words!</em> If we succeed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
the children of these very men who are now
fighting us will rise up to call us blessed. Just
as surely as there is a God who governs in the
world, so surely all the laws of national prosperity
follow in the train of equity; and if we
succeed, we shall have delivered the children’s
children of our misguided brethren from the
wages of sin, which is always and everywhere
death.</p>

<p>And now, Sisters of England, think it not
strange, if we bring back the words of your
letter, not in bitterness, but in deepest sadness,
and lay them down at your door. We say to
you,—Sisters, you have spoken well; we have
heard you; we have heeded; we have striven
in the cause, even unto death. We have
sealed our devotion by desolate hearth and
darkened homestead,—by the blood of sons,
husbands, and brothers. In many of our
dwellings the very light of our lives has gone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
out; and yet we accept the life-long darkness
as our own part in this great and awful expiation,
by which the bonds of wickedness shall
be loosed, and abiding peace established on the
foundation of righteousness. Sisters, what
have <em>you</em> done, and what do you mean to do?</p>

<p>In view of the decline of the noble anti-slavery
fire in England, in view of all the facts
and admissions recited from your own papers,
we beg leave in solemn sadness to return to
you your own words:—</p>

<p>“A common origin, a common faith, and
we sincerely believe, a common cause, urge
us, at the present moment, to address you on
the subject of that fearful encouragement and
support which is being afforded by England to
a slaveholding Confederacy.</p>

<p>“We will not dwell on the ordinary topics,—on
the progress of civilization, on the advance
of freedom everywhere, on the rights<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
and requirements of the nineteenth century;
but we appeal to you very seriously to reflect
and to ask counsel of God how far such a state
of things is in accordance with His Holy
Word, the inalienable rights of immortal
souls, and the pure and merciful spirit of the
Christian religion.</p>

<p>“We appeal to you, as sisters, as wives, and
as mothers, to raise your voices to your fellow-citizens,
and your prayers to God, for the removal
of this affliction and disgrace from the
Christian world.”</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em;">Dr. Worcester’s New and Greatly Enlarged Dictionary of the
English Language. Adapted for Library or College Reference, comprising
40,000 Words more than Johnson’s Dictionary, and 250 pages more

<p>“The volumes before us show a vast amount of diligence; but with
Webster it is diligence in combination with fancifulness,—with Worcester in
combination with good sense and judgment. Worcester’s is the soberer and
safer book, and may be pronounced the best existing English Lexicon.”—
<em>Athenæum</em>, July 13, 1861.
</p>

<p>“We will now take leave of this magnificent monument of patient toil, careful
research, judicious selection, and magnanimous self-denial (for it requires
great self-denial to abstain from undesired originality), with a hearty wish
for its success. It is sad to think that the result of so much labour, from
which Hercules, had he been intellectually inclined, would have shrunk appalled,
should be barren fame; yet we can easily believe that Dr. Worcester
(as he says) expects no adequate pecuniary compensation for his gigantic undertaking:
for it is difficult to imagine a sum which could adequately compensate
the man who has produced the completest and the cheapest English
Dictionary which the world has yet seen.”—<cite>Critic.</cite></p>

<p>“A succinct history of the American quarrel, with an estimate of its
probable cause and proximate issue. To the information Mr. Ellison has already
acquired, he has added a faculty of inference equal to the occasion,
and such a rational estimate of the work required of him, that he has compiled
a convenient book of reference, available in some other respects to the
journalist and politician.”—<cite>Times.</cite></p>

on the Slave States; volumes full of acute, pithy, and significant delineations,
which bear in every line the stamp of an honest and unexaggerating,

which significant but complex social facts are so fairly, minutely, and intelligently

in which all the evidence given is at once so minute and so
essential; and the inferences deduced so practical, broad, and impressive.</em>”—Spectator.</p>

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a

by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
